    <p>
When a man loves a woman<br>
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else<br>
He'd trade the world<br>
For the good thing he's found<br>
If she is bad, he can't see it<br>
She can do no wrong<br>
And turn his back on his <a href="https://bestfriends.org/">best friend</a><br>
If he puts her down
</p>
<br>
<p>
When a man loves a woman<br>
Spend his very last dime<br>
And trying to hold on to what he needs<br>
He'd give up all his comforts<br>
And sleep out in the rain<br>
If she said that's the way it ought to be, eh
</p>
<br>
<p>
When a man loves a woman, eh<br>
I give you everything I've got<br>
Trying to hold on to your precious love<br>
And baby baby please don't treat me bad
</p>
<br>
<p>
When a man loves a woman, eh<br>
Deep down in his soul<br>
She can bring him such misery<br>
If she is playing him for a fool<br>
He's the last one to know<br>
Loving eyes can never see
</p>
<br>
<p>
Yes, when a man loves a woman<br>
I know exactly how he feels<br>
'Cause baby,  <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/baby"><cite>baby</cite></a><br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
When a man loves a woman, whoa<br>
When a man loves a woman, oh<br>
When a man loves a woman (when a man loves a woman)<br>
When a man, when a man<br>
When a man loves a woman<br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh (when a man loves a woman)
