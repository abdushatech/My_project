    <h1>When a Man Loves a Woman</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="first paragraph">
        When a man loves a woman<br>
        Can't keep his mind on nothin' else<br>
        He'd trade the world<br>
        For the good thing he's found<br>
        If she is bad, he can't see it<br>
        She can do no wrong<br>
        And turn his back on his <a href="https://bestfriends.org/">best friend</a><br>
        If he puts her down
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">
        When a man loves a woman<br>
        Spend his very last dime<br>
        And trying to hold on to what he needs<br>
        He'd give up all his comforts<br>
        And sleep out in the rain<br>
        If she said that's the way it ought to be, eh
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        When a man loves a woman, eh<br>
        I give you everything I've got<br>
        Trying to hold on to your precious love<br>
        And baby baby please don't treat me bad
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">
        When a man loves a woman, eh<br>
        Deep down in his soul<br>
        She can bring him such misery<br>
        If she is playing him for a fool<br>
        He's the last one to know<br>
        Loving eyes can never see
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>
        Yes, when a man loves a woman<br>
        I know exactly how he feels<br>
        'Cause baby,  <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/baby"><cite>baby</cite></a><br>
    </strong>

    <p id="last-paragraph">
        When a man loves a woman, whoa<br>
        When a man loves a woman, oh<br>
        When a man loves a woman (when a man loves a woman)<br>
        When a man, when a man<br>
        When a man loves a woman<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh (when a man loves a woman)
